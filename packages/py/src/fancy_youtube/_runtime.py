"""The minimum connector runtime, in the standard library only.

PROVENANCE — read before editing.

This is the SINGLE SOURCE for the Python connector runtime, and it is
deliberately much smaller than ``@particle-academy/fancy-connector-core``. It
exists because that package has a TypeScript implementation and a PHP twin and
**no Python twin at all**. Every generated ``fancy-<provider>`` package carries
a copy emitted from this file, and ``new-provider.mjs --check`` fails CI when a
copy differs.

The permanent fix is a Python ``fancy-connector-core``. When it exists, this
file becomes a re-export and every provider picks it up on the next protocol
sync.

## What it does, and what it deliberately does not

It owns the WIRE: the estate, the auth placement, one call path, the faker
branch, an idempotency header, and HMAC delivery verification.

It owns NO GATE. Approval, liveness, consent, second review and every journal
belong to the host, because each is enforced in ONE place and every connector
inherits it from the dispatch path rather than implementing it.

Three properties that are asserted rather than promised:

- **Nothing here reads the environment.** Credentials are arguments. A package
  that reached for ``os.environ`` would bypass the host's discipline entirely.
- **Nothing here retries an ambiguous failure.** A request that may or may not
  have arrived is repeated only when the caller has said repeating it is
  harmless.
- **Nothing here phones home.** No telemetry, no central service, and no URL
  this module contacts that the connector did not name.

## Zero dependencies is a constraint, not an accident

``urllib`` for HTTP, ``hmac``/``hashlib`` for signatures. A vendor SDK is
third-party code subject to the kit's full approval bar, and one SDK per
provider is hundreds of dependencies nobody is tracking.
