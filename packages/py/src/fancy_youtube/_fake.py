"""Deterministic faker values — bit-for-bit with TypeScript and PHP.

PROVENANCE — read before editing.

This is the SINGLE SOURCE for the Python faker helpers. It exists because
``fancy-connector-core`` has a TypeScript implementation and a PHP twin and
**no Python twin at all**, so a generated ``fancy-<provider>`` package has no
shared runtime to import. Every generated package carries a copy emitted from
this file, and ``new-provider.mjs --check`` fails CI when a copy differs.

The permanent fix is a Python ``fancy-connector-core``. When it exists, this
file becomes a re-export and every provider picks it up on the next protocol
sync.

## Bit-for-bit identical is the whole point

Not "similar": the same FNV-1a seed and the same xorshift32 sequence, so a
golden fixture asserts the exact faked payload and ALL THREE runtimes have to
produce it. That turns the faker into a parity test rather than a convenience —
which matters, because cross-runtime drift does not fail loudly. It completes,
down one path, with no error.

Python integers are unbounded, so every 32-bit operation is masked back into
range. Dropping one of those masks does not break anything visibly; it just
makes the runtimes diverge after a few hundred calls, which is the worst
possible way for this to fail.

## Deterministic, and obviously fake

Same inputs, same output — always. A faker returning a fresh uuid every call
cannot be asserted on, so its fixtures degrade to "it did not throw", which is
the assertion that catches nothing. And the values are obviously synthetic ON
PURPOSE — ``fake_``-prefixed ids, ``example.test`` hosts, round numbers. Nobody
should ever look at a faked result and wonder whether it moved real money.
