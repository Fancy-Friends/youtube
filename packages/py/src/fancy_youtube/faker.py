"""The YouTube faker.

Bit-for-bit identical to the TypeScript and PHP fakers: the same FNV-1a seed
and the same xorshift32 sequence, so a golden fixture asserts the exact
faked payload and ALL THREE runtimes have to produce it. That turns the
faker into a parity test rather than a convenience — which matters, because
cross-runtime drift does not fail loudly. It completes, down one path, with
no error.
