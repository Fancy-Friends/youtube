 * host:
 *
 * - `YoutubeFlow::register($kinds, $executors)` — one call, no directory scan.
 * - Laravel: add this directory to `config('fancy-flow.discover')`.
 *
 * Reading the list needs no engine: `::class` is a string and a parameter type
 * is not loaded until the method runs, so this file loads on a host without
 * fancy-flow-php. The executors themselves do not, and are not meant to.
