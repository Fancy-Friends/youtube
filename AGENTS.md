# AGENTS.md — YouTube

**This whole repository is generated.** `provider/` is the source; everything
under `packages/` is emitted from it by [weaver][weaver], the envelope that owns
this estate. There is no hand-written code here.

[weaver]: https://github.com/Fancy-Friends/weaver.agi

## The one rule

**Never hand-edit anything under `packages/`.** Fix `provider/` — or fix
weaver's `template/` — and regenerate. A hand-edit is destroyed by the next
protocol sync, which is *worse* than being rejected, because it works until it
silently doesn't. `ci.yml` regenerates and diffs on every push, so an edit here
fails the build rather than shipping.

```bash
# in the weaver envelope
npm run provider -- youtube            # regenerate this repo
npm run provider -- youtube --check    # exit 1 on any difference
```

## The pull request titled "chore: regenerate from the envelope"

It was opened by weaver's protocol sweep, on the branch `sync/protocol`, and it
carries a change made to `template/` for EVERY provider at once — a new required
check, a changed publish step, an action version moving off a deprecated
runtime. The diff is the generator's output, not somebody's edit.

**Review it, then merge it.** Two things not to do:

- **Do not push commits onto that branch.** The sweep force-updates it, so an
  edit there is destroyed by the next run — the same failure as hand-editing a
  generated file, just further from where anyone would look for it.
- **Do not close it and fix this repo instead.** The change came from the
  envelope and every other provider is getting it. Fixing it here diverges this
  repo from the template, which is the one state the estate cannot carry.

If the change is wrong, it is wrong in `template/` — say so and it is fixed
once, for all of them.

## What is where

| Path | What | Hand-written? |
|---|---|---|
| `provider/manifest.json` | Service identity, auth, estates, idempotency | **Yes** |
| `provider/actions/*.json` | One per operation: request, config schema, output shape | **Yes** |
| `provider/triggers/*.json` | Delivery mechanism and signature scheme | **Yes** |
| `provider/fixtures/*.json` | Faker responses — required for every action and trigger | **Yes** |
| `packages/ui` | `@particle-academy/youtube-ui` — the authoring surface, React, every host | Generated |
| `packages/js` | `@particle-academy/youtube-js` — Node, on `@particle-academy/fancy-connector-core` | Generated |
| `packages/php` | `particle-academy/youtube-php` — PHP 8.4, on `particle-academy/fancy-connector-core` | Generated |
| `packages/py` | `fancy-youtube` — Python 3.11+, stdlib only | Generated |

The authoritative copy of `provider/` lives in the weaver envelope at
`providers/youtube/provider/`. The copy here is emitted from it and `--check`
fails when the two differ — one source, two distribution channels, and the check
is what makes that safe.

## Two namespaces, which do not match on purpose

| | Namespace |
|---|---|
| This repo | `github.com/Fancy-Friends/youtube` |
| npm | `@particle-academy/youtube-ui`, `@particle-academy/youtube-js` |
| Packagist | `particle-academy/youtube-php` |
| PyPI | `fancy-youtube` |

Nothing derives one from the other. Naming a package after its GitHub org is the
intuitive mistake, and **on npm it cannot be undone**. The names come from
weaver's `friends.json` and nowhere else.

## Invariants CI enforces

- **A faker for every action and trigger**, sandbox or no sandbox. A connector
  without one cannot be developed against, tested, or demonstrated.
- **The golden fixtures assert the same bytes in TypeScript, PHP and Python.**
  That is the parity test: cross-runtime drift does not fail loudly on its own —
  it completes, down one path, with no error.
- **Every package ships a test script.** A package without one reports green by
  doing nothing, which is the one defect that hides itself.
- **A CHANGELOG entry at tag time**, checked before anything is built.
- **`CONNECTOR_API_VERSION` is declared as a literal, never imported.** An
  imported constant lets an upgrade rewrite the very claim it exists to detect.

## Third-party code

**Default to plain HTTP.** A YouTube SDK is third-party code and is subject to
the kit's full bar: owner approval, and a project updated within the last 3
months. One SDK per provider is hundreds of dependencies nobody is tracking, and
the generator cannot introduce one on its own — a test asserts every dependency
is first-party.

## Process rules live in the envelope

Publishing, versioning, backports, the support lifecycle and the third-party
approval bar are in the Fancy envelope's `AGENTS.md`. They are deliberately not
repeated here: a copy in a repo freezes at whatever the rule was the day it was
written, and then quietly contradicts the real one.
